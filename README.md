# Psitegrad's Cooking Rebalance for Made in Abyss BSFD

A mod that aims to rebalance cooking recipes in this game.  
We are delvers that put our lives on the line while challenging the abyss, we can handle some food without salt.

Note that this is my personal preference, salt was removed from the most cooked recipes and left where I think it would make sense or if the requirement is high enough on its own that you should be sufficiently prepared to make it in the first place.


### Description

+ Removed salt requirement for a number of recipes.
+ Reduced ingredients requirement for a number of recipes.
+ Increased ingredients requirement for a select few recipes.

Maybe a fellow diver will find an use for it.
